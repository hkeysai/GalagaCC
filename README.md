# Galaga

My clone of the arcade game Galaga written in Python with the Pygame library. 
Much inspiration for organization of code was taken from this repo: <https://github.com/Hyungmook/MarioLevel1>.
This project is not complete and is still in progress!
The current goal is to implement the first 3 stages.

## Note

I do not want to work on this project anymore, but if you want to contribute, feel free to! I will respond to any pull requests.

## How to run

Run `python galaga.py` in terminal after you make sure all the dependencies for Python are met.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or greater
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) v1.9.6 

## The Game
The point of the game is to get through as many stages as possible and get the high score.

## Controls

Controlled with the keyboard.

* Right = move the ship right
* Left = move the ship left
* Enter = "start" function
* Space = make the ship fire its missile
* (Debug only) K = kill the player

## Disclaimer

I did not create the sound effects, music, or sprite images.
I do not intend to profit from this project. It is only for educational purposes.
